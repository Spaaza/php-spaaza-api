### Agent Knowledge Base

- Purpose: capture durable, repo-specific tips that help future agents work on this PHP client.
- Public-only rule: this repository is public, so do not add confidential, internal, or customer-specific information. Avoid private endpoints, credentials, internal tooling, or non-public workflows.
- Usage: read relevant notes before starting work; add or update topic files when you learn new flows, pitfalls, or expectations that are safe to share publicly.
- Scope: API client usage patterns, request/response behavior, dependency/versioning notes, or testing guidance (if added later).
- Format: concise Markdown by topic (not per PR). Include short examples and link to code paths when useful.
